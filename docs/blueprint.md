## Core Features:
new branch
- Mega Menu Configuration: Allow merchants to build and configure a mega menu with nested menus and image blocks within the dropdown, configurable via the theme editor.
- Transparent Header with Scroll State: Implement a header that is initially transparent, overlapping hero images, but transitions to a solid background color on scroll. This should be togglable in the theme settings.
- Advanced Product Filtering (AJAX): Utilize Shopify's native Storefront Filtering (facets) and ensure that filtering on collection pages is AJAX-driven to prevent full page reloads.
- Product Card Enhancements: Enhance product cards with color swatches linked to variant images, a 'Quick Add' button on hover (desktop), and a second-image swap on hover.
- Sticky Add-to-Cart Bar (Mobile): Implement a 'Sticky Add-to-Cart' bar on mobile devices that appears when the user scrolls past the main add-to-cart button.
- Accordion Sections for Product Details: Use accordion-style sections for the product description, materials, and shipping information on the Product Detail Page (PDP) to conserve vertical space.
- Free Shipping Progress Bar: Include a free shipping progress bar within the Cart Drawer (AJAX) to incentivize upsells.
